/* 7. Edit the css for the card class to match our example. 
Achieve this by using a flex-property to specify an initial ‚Äúsize‚Äù of 450px.

 realize that flex-direction will affect the size of the elements.

The following specifications are for when the screen-size is greater than 900px
Observe the screenshot from 1200px

11. Edit the css for the header tag (all instances) and the nav_links class
# to match our example using flex-properties. The logo should be as far to
 the left as possible and the links as far to the right as possible. 
 Use flex properties, NOT position properties.

 12. Edit the css for the pricing and card classes to match our example.
  Part of achieving this is by using a flex-property to specify a ‚Äúsize‚Äù
   of 275px. Notice that the elements do not have the same height, but do 
   have the same width.

13. Modify the first header (the one not inside main) so that
 it remains visible at the top of the screen even as we scroll down.
  Make sure that it is always visible. You can see an example of this 
  in the video and in the screenshot at 1200px when scrolled. This is a 
  challenge problem. You should not give or receive help when completing it.

The following specifications are for when the page is printed in portrait mode.  		
View the print view from Firefox on regular sized paper in portrait mode (portrait mode is the default mode).


Change the font on your body to Arial with a backup value of  Helvetica


The background image should be removed. 


Edit the nav/nav_links elements so that they are spaced according to the image above.


Edit the pricing class so that the elements align along the bottom.  As long as it aligns along the bottom we don't care if the cards aren't the same height.


The card elements should have a solid border 2px of #45ADDD and use flex-basis of 325px. 


No part of the gallery should be visible.


Without using list-style-type add the thumbs up entity as shown in the cards. This is a challenge problem. You should not give or receive help when completing it.**For some people the thumbs up is not printing as yellow. That is fine.
